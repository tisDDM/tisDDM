## About Me

Hi — I’m Tim. 

I founded Das Digitale Momentum GmbH & Co KG and, with my team, we build and operate software and provide IT operations and consultancy for large companies. We focus on DevOps, Big Data & AI, cloud and edge computing, and customer self-service support systems.

Even as a founder and consultant I stay hands‑on: I prototype PoCs, turn ideas into MVPs, and prepare live demos and presentations for conferences. I prefer practical, working results over buzzwords and enjoy the moment a prototype actually proves an idea.
