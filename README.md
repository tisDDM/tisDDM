## About Me

Hi — I’m Tim. 

I founded Das Digitale Momentum GmbH & Co KG and, with my team, we build and operate software and provide IT operations and consultancy for large companies. We focus on DevOps, Big Data & AI, cloud and edge computing, and customer self-service support systems.

I still stay hands‑on: I create PoCs, turn ideas into MVPs, and prepare live demos and presentations for conferences. Practical work & working results over buzzwords. I enjoy the moment when a prototype actually hit the road and proves my idea.
