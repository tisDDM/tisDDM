## About Me

Hi — I’m Tim. 

I founded Das Digitale Momentum GmbH & Co KG and, with my team, we build and operate software and provide IT operations and consultancy for large companies. We focus on DevOps, Big Data & AI, cloud and edge computing, and customer self-service support systems.

I still stay hands‑on: I create PoCs, turn ideas into MVPs, and prepare live demos and presentations for conferences. Practical work & working results over buzzwords. I enjoy the moment when a prototype actually hit the road and proves my idea.


## Ongoing 

- Multi‑step Agentic Information Retrieval System for a MongoDB containing customer service mass data. Turn natural language questions from sales employees into data retrieval and execution plans using business‑level specification documents.
- AI‑based Document Processing: PDF Invoice Transformation for a business intelligence system. Enable the cubes to process "old‑school" financial transactions.
- Fun project: Learning foreign languages with multimodal real‑time language models. Resolving problems with non‑English languages like German and European Portuguese.
- Data privacy: Enable publicly appointed and sworn experts. Process classified documents locally & self‑hosted.
